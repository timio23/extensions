## Usage

The graph will be rendered within the new panel. While small, the graph won't show legends or labels. Hover over data points to reveal the value (if enabled).

If you choose to group the data into different series, a legend will appear at the bottom. Hover over a series in the legend to highlight all data for that series. You can also toggle which series are visible by clicking the series label in the legend.

You can change the following options:

- Collection Selection
- Filters
- Label Field
- Value Field
- Group Aggregation (Sum, Average, Count, Max and Min)
- Series Field
- Hide/Show Labels
- Hide/Show Tooltips
- Color

## Requirements

- Directus 10.10.0+
- String field for the Label and Series
- Integer, BigInteger, Float or Decimal field for Value
- Fields must be in the same table
